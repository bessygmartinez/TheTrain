# Train Data Unlimited
## Train Arrival Times

This is an application for users to add trains to the schedule to calculate when their next train is coming, in real-time. Just add the name, destination, frequency of the train's arrival, and the train's first departure time and it will calculate the time it will arrive and the minutes until it arrives.

The design is based off Wes Anderson's movie, The Darjeeling Limited.
